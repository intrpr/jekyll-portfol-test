## Practical applications of transliterated work product

<p class="lead">If Deaf people prefer American Sign Language as their primary language, where/why would they ever use transliteration? Surprisingly enough, transliteration is used in the same settings as signed-language interpretation; where and how is transliterating used?</p>

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* In what settings is transliteration preferred?
* What and when do consumers prefer transliteration and why? How would I practically apply transliteration?
* Who uses transliteration? What is the (documented or otherwise) measureable impact on consumer cognition? Miscue/error perception?
