<p class="lead">Wrapping up our discussions on interpretation production, self-monitoring focuses on arguably the hardest of the discourse mapping skills, monitoring one’s own work production. What skills and factors must successful interpreters monitor while working?</p>

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* What tasks do you do now that require you to self monitor and measure your progress and product? How do you do that?
* What are we looking for as we self-monitor our own intepreting processes?
