<p class="lead">Arguably the greatest challenge to equivalency in an interpretation event is the ability to control the data shared during the event: who did what to whom? What was the number? Did s/he just spell ‘car’ or ‘cat’?</p>

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* How do I learn? Am I more of a verbal, auditory, or kinesthetic learner? How does that impact my ability to produce a real-time spoken language interpretation?
* Or, where are my learning strengths? How do multiple intelligences help me understand my abilities in producing interpretations?
* How do I deal with message ‘decay’? Why do I make miscues?
* How can I harness the power of cognitive load in producing a spoken language interpretation?

Readings/Discussions

### [VARK Questionnaire](http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire)
Take this learning preferences style assessment to see where your learning tendencies might be focused. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

Related: Try the [Big](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/personality-quiz/) [Five](http://www.personalitylab.org/tests/bfi2_self_pol.htm) personality quiz or even try the [Myers-Briggs](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp) [personality exam](http://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) or for more detailed information on your learning and psychological preferences. The goal here is not to create a diagnosis, but to identify how you personally process (or dual process) information in an interpreting event.

### Multiple Intelligences
Howard Gardner proposed the concept of ‘multiple intelligences’ to challenge the concept of IQs; various intelligences (at least eight of them) indicate where various types of information are processed and comprehended. Gardner contrasts multiple intelligences against learning styles, explaining them as “abilities,” rather than approaches to tasks. For a little more insight into your multiple intelligences, try your hand at an intelligences assessment. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">Recommended</span>

### The Science of Automating and Perfecting Any Skill
Achieving automaticity is about making a newly learned skill a part of who you are, as opposed to just a thing you can do. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [How To Learn In 2 Days What Normally Takes 6 Months](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-learn-in-2-days-what-normally-takes-6-months-af9a1556f66e)
Article reminds that process to learning skills and tasks is relatively straightforward (context-based learning): ‘learn’ a concept, practice/use it in a real-world scenario, get coaching and feedback, rinse and repeat.

### [Quora: How does the human brain decide which memories to store?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-human-brain-decide-which-memories-to-store)
Quora discussion/explanation about how information is actually stored and recalled; cf. some of our other discussions (on this page) about how this is accomplished. What is the application for sign language interpreting?

### [How Memory Works: 10 Things Most People Get Wrong](https://www.spring.org.uk/2012/10/how-memory-works-10-things-most-people-get-wrong.php)
I’m not a huge fan of the ‘10 Things’ genre, but this is especially germane to our discussion.

### [Designing Experience Design](https://medium.com/@kurren/designing-experience-design-24b18a670cbc)
Tangential to interpreting, the field of user experience spends a great deal of effort in understanding how users cognitively and psychologically process presented information. This article discusses cognitive effort, schema/schemata, and gestalt principles as a way of taxonomizing information. Nerd alert, but helpful in seeing that interpreters aren’t the only ones doing this.

Related: [How human memory works (tips for designers)](https://uxplanet.org/how-human-memory-works-tips-for-ux-designers-12b14071bdf9): interface designers leverage human memory triggers and tactics to create stories and memorable experiences. Interpreter ‘designers’ do the same thing.

### [Why we forget](http://www.salon.com/2011/11/20/why_we_forget)
Science shows our memory can easily be distorted and erased — but our forgetfulness also helps us survive.

### [Cognitive Biases: Why We Make Irrational Decisions](http://www.spring.org.uk/2013/02/cognitive-biases-why-we-make-irrational-decisions.php)
Less an article and more a list of other articles, this ‘article’ helps us reevaluate why we make bad — or inequivalent — decision in our interpreting work.

### [Anosognosia or The Dunning & Kruger Effect](http://)
Ever wonder why some people don’t see or think that they make errors? It’s because we don’t know what we don’t know. Here’s the paper/research. [Beware the juice](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/the-anosognosics-dilemma-1/).

### [Do You Suffer From Decision Fatigue?](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html)
2011 NYT article on the very real issue of defining the energy needed to make decisions and exercise self-control. What is the relationship to SL interpreting?

#### Cognitive Load Theory

### [Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load)
CLT has roots in work by instructional psychologists [Miller](https://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/information-processing/) (1956; concept of 7±2;) and Simon & Chase (1973; “chunking”) and is the subject of a large body of study by [John Sweller](https://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/cognitive-load/) (1988, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, et al) at the University of New South Wales. Sweller’s work primarily deals with the amount of information/cognition that is transmitted in instruction (SL interpreters as ‘instructors’ anyone?) but the findings are clearly germane to SL interpreters and their work. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [CLT: Dual-coding theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-coding_theory)
First discussed by Allan Paivio, dual-coding theory hypothesizes that visual and verbal information are processed in different areas of the brain and schemas for each are produced in different visual and verbal channels. What implications does this have for how SL interpreters create schema for information in each channel? <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Muscle memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory)
Muscle memory is the concept of training behaviors (or literally, gross/fine motor skills) to be automatic; we perform tasks almost subconsciously and/or without purposely thinking because we’ve performed the task multiple times. [There is an analog to this](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1087) in the design of the user interfaces of our phones, iPods, etc. Does muscle memory also apply to SL interpreting? What skills (if any) can be made automatic and what skills (if any) must remain outside of automatcity? Additional reading in [Karni & Meyer, et al (1998)](http://). Here’s a [visual example of how a two-and-a-half year-old creates muscle memory with an iPad](http://ipad-research.tumblr.com/post/876179082/2-5-y-o-girl-teaches-us-how-young-children). <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [An introduction to efficiency in learning](http://)
This is Chapter 1 of Clark, R. C.; Nguyen, F; & Sweller, J. (2006). Efficiency in learning: evidence-based guidelines to manage cognitive load. (pp. 1–13) New York: John Wiley and Sons. This short chapter gives an introduction to CLT, explains a broad taxonomy of types of cognitive load (‘intrinsic’, ‘germane/relevant’, and ‘extraneous/irrelevant’), and gives an introduction to techniques in managing these kinds of load. (Read pp. 9–13.)

### [Improving traditional instruction: Cognitive load theory](http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~bwilson/cog/sweller.html)
This excerpt (pp. 603–605) from Wilson, Brent & Cole, Peggy (1996), Cognitive teaching models. In D. H. Jonassen (Ed.), Handbook of research for educational communications and technology (pp. 601-621). New York: MacMillan is a simplified explanation of CLT; how does this apply to SL interpreting work?
