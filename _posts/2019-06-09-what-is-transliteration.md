## Defining something that has historically resisted definition

<p class="lead">Though its merits and practice have been debated since Ball State and the early days of professional interpreting, there is not a good consensus about the definition, process, and successful outcome or product of transliteration. In order to become better practitioners of transliteration, we need to 1) better understand what it is and what it is not and 2) discuss differences and similarities in the process, product, skills and abilities, and application of transliterating work.</p>

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* How has transliteration been defined since 1964? Why doesn’t transliteration have a consistent definition?
* Using the concept of ‘user stories,’ create definitions of how transliteration can be used by different audiences.
* What does the published literature have to say about descriptions/definitions of signed-language transliteration?
* What are the main themes of these notable researchers in this domain of professional signed-language interpreting?
	* Fleischer (efficacy of interpreting vs. transliterating)
	* Winston (definition; required skills/strategies)
	* Siple (audience, additions, pausing)
	* Sofinski (defintion; required skills/strategies; nonmanual behaviors)
	* Malcolm (definition; ‘contact’ languages)
	* Viera & Stauffer (consumer perspective)

### Crafting a user story
[User stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) are popular in agile software developing environments; they are specifically formulated and written to represent business value that a development team can deliver in an iteration period. User stories typically shift focus away from requirements and help developers identify [a user type, function, and benefit](https://help.rallydev.com/writing-great-user-story) or a [role, feature, and reason](http://codesqueeze.com/the-easy-way-to-writing-good-user-stories). How can [user stories](http://theuxreview.co.uk/user-stories-the-beginners-guide) help us define transliteration better in context? How many ‘user type/roles’ are there? What are the benefits for these user types? <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Transliteration: What’s the message? (Winston)](http://)
(pp. 147–151) Winston’s 1989 article should probably be considered the seminal writing on transliteration in professional signed-language interpreting. This article set out a definition (such as it is) of the practice and empirically looks at skills and communication strategies that a test transliterator used in producing work. Winston, E.A. (1989). “Transliteration: What’s the message?” In C. Lucas (Ed.), Sociolinguistics of the Deaf Community, 147–164.

### [Transliterating: The interpreting no one wants to talk about (Malcolm)](http://)
Both this and Malcolm’s 2005 article give good definitions of transliteration, its product and process, the concept of ‘contact sign,’ and the impact of transliterated product on consumers.
