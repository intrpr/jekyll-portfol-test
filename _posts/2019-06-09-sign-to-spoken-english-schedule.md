## [Contexting interpretive ‘work’ and de-personalizing feedback](http://)

<small>
Thursday, 8 August<br>

One of the greatest struggles of the professional signed language interpreting field is the difficulty practitioners have in depersonalizing work product. Let’s break that cycle; interpreting evaluation is a scientific process concerned with gathering data and scrutinizing equivalency of message from source to target, not adjectival commentary on the interpreter’s ‘goodness’ or ‘badness.’ Let’s do this.

Developing competent spoken English skills is something you’ve been working on for decades. Now let’s combine comprehension, context, and a little bit of brain muscle to create equivalency in an interpreting event.

“Which road do I take?,” Alice asked.
“Where do you want to go?,” the Chesire Cat replied.
“I don’t know,” Alice answered.
“Then,” said the Cat, “it doesn’t matter.”
(Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland)

Cognitive organization of a text can help interpreters mentally plan out (roadmap and signpost; Mindess, 2006) and know where the intent of a text or discourse is going.

## [Attending and listening](http://)

<small>
Thursday, 8 August<br>

We’ll focus on... well, focusing. Listening for intent and context is more than just looking for signs that are recognizable. Listening and attending includes both how interpreters access source materials but then also convert messages through comprehension.

## Field trip

To be determined

We’re planning to visit the local chapter of Toastmasters to see what public speaking practice looks like. Fulfills one of the Community Exposure assignments we’re doing this semester.

## [Managing memory issues in an interpretation](http://)

<small>
Thursday, 8 August<br>

Human cognition is terribly unique and idiosyncratic and yet more understood now than every before. Understanding what the brain does during an interpreting event leads to better equivalent work product.

## [Constructing message and meaning](http://)

<small>
Thursday, 8 August<br>
Tuesday, 13 August<br>
Thursday, 15 August
</small> 

This section is intended to focus on the DNA and morphology of message. Colonomos’ work point interpreters towards understanding the complex modular parts of what people say, the context, demography, history and etymology: everything that frames and shapes an intended message.
