Because I don’t have office hours, you may contact me at any time via e-mail or by arranging a meeting time before or after class, or try one of these methods:

* dstringham (at) gmail.com (also Google Hangouts and FaceTime)
* [Canvas](https://uvu.instructure.com)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stringd)
* [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com)

## On campus

This semester, catch or make an appointment with me before/after class in **LI 212**.

## Phone

If you absolutely need to use the phone, you may call my mobile phone (ask me for the number); please do not call my home (do you *really* want my teenaged kids answering your important call?).

## ASL & Deaf Studies Department Chair

Hopefully, you won’t need to bother my supervisor, but if you must, you can contact the ASL & Deaf Studies Coordinator, Dr. Bryan Eldredge, LA003f; (801) 863-8529 V/VP.
