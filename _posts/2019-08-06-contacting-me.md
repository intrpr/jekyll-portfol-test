## Contacting Me

You may contact me at any time via e-mail or by arranging a meeting time before or after class. If you need to contact me, try these methods:

* dstringham (at) gmail.com (also Google Hangouts and FaceTime)
* [Canvas](https://uvu.instructure.com/)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stringd)
* [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/)

## On campus

* Catch or make an appointment with me before/after class in LI 212.

## Phone

If you absolutely need to use the phone, you may call my mobile phone (ask me for the number); please do not call my home (do you *really* want my teenaged kids answering your important call?).

## ASL & Deaf Studies Department Chair

Hopefully, you wonâ€™t need to bother my supervisor, but if you must, you can contact the ASL & Deaf Studies Coordinator, Dr. Bryan Eldredge, LA003f; (801) 863-8529 V/VP.
