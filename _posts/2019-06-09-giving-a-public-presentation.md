The Japanese have long figured out concise, efficient, and interesting ways to give presentations (e.g., [Takahashi Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) or [Kawasaki Method](https://guykawasaki.com/the_102030_rule)). More recently, the concept of [Pecha Kucha](https://paulgordonbrown.com/2014/12/13/your-ultimate-guide-to-giving-pechakucha-presentations) (ペチャクチャ, Japanese for 'chit chat'), like Kawasaki, encourages twenty slides at twenty seconds each. What impact does this have on how you organize your information?
