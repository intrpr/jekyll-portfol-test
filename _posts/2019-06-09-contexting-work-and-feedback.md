Readings/Discussions

### [Feedback: A Conversation about ‘The Work’ Between Learners and Colleagues (Witter-Merithew)](http://)
This article contains an unpublished article (2001) by Anna Witter-Merithew, Director of the Mid-America Regional Interpreter Education Center (MARIE) and an assistant director of the [DoIT Center (now Department of American Sign Language and Interpreting Studies) at the University of Northern Colorado](http://www.unco.edu/doit), regarding how we have historically spoken about interpreting work and posits a new paradigm of discussion. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Non-evaluative feedback language (Colonomos)](http://)
Colonomos’ “yellow sheet.” Simple yet essential recontexting of feedback language we use with interpreter colleagues. To be used in class discussions and interpretive work processing. Live it. Love it. Learn it. (Don’t download this unless you lose the yellow copy handed out in class.) <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Does gender style contribute to tech industry diversity?](http://)
A more-recent corollary to Morgan’s article, this discussion of resume writing styles in Fortune Magazine explores an interesting point about the different (perceived) narrative style of men and women. Author Kieran Snyder observes differences in writing length, detail inclusion, credential inclusion, and personal background. How do these styles impact message creation, (does it) impact Deaf narrative creation, and interpretation approaches?

### [Simons/Chabris Selective Attention Test](http://)

### [Listening to humor and comedy](http://)
President Obama’s performance and Cecily Strong’s standup set from the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. How does a listener (much less an interpreter) learn to distinguish from surface-level language choices and deeper semantic intent? Where does the comedy actually take place? Is the ‘funny’ in the delivery or the semantic intent? What is required to render L1 semantics in an L2?

### [How to Wield Empathy](http://)
Admittedly, this article has nothing directly to do with SL interpreting; it’s about user experience design, the practice of getting into the psychology of web/internet use. But replace “design” with “interpret” and the sentiment takes on a new light. Is there room for ‘user/consumer’ empathy in our work?

### [Powerless language: Are your words holding you back?](http://)

### [Eye fixation study](http://)
Eye fixation study results show how we actually read and process texts. What implications does this have for interpreters?
