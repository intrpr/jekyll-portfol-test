## Learning to talk about our work as a function of ‘work,’ not of ‘me’

One of the greatest struggles of the professional signed language interpreting field is the difficulty practitioners have in depersonalizing work product. Discussing interpretation work is a scientific process, concerned with gathering data and scrutinizing equivalency of message from source to target, not adjectival commentary on an interpretation’s ‘goodness’ or ‘badness.’ However, talking about ‘equivalence’ in transliterative decisions is different and requires more subjectivity; there is less room for creativity and interpretation in a transliterated event.

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* What kind of language should we use when we’re giving formative feedback to each other? Because interpretation evaluation criteria is slightly different, what language should we use when we’re talking about transliterated work product?
* What rubric(s) should inform our evaluations of transliterated work product?
* Based on what we read in Witter-Merrithew and Colonomos, how can we measure equivalency and accuracy in our transliterations?

Readings/Discussions

### [Feedback: A Conversation about ‘The Work’ Between Learners and Colleagues (Witter-Merithew)](http://)
This article contains an unpublished article (2001) by Anna Witter-Merithew, Director of the Mid-America Regional Interpreter Education Center (MARIE) and an assistant director of the [DoIT Center (now Department of American Sign Language and Interpreting Studies) at the University of Northern Colorado](http://www.unco.edu/doit), regarding how we have historically spoken about interpreting work and posits a new paradigm of discussion. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Non-evaluative feedback language (Colonomos)](http://)
Colonomos’ “yellow sheet.” Simple yet essential recontexting of feedback language we use with interpreter colleagues. To be used in class discussions and interpretive work processing. Live it. Love it. Learn it. (Don’t download this unless you lose the yellow copy handed out in class.)

### [Consumers and Service Effectiveness in Interpreting Work: A Practice Profession Perspective (2005)](http://)
Article by Dean & Pollard (2005) discusses the concept of SL interpreting as a practice profession and why overlooking outside factors on SL interpreters is potentially dangerous to the profession. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Application of Demand-Control Theory to Sign Language Interpreting: Implications for Stress and Interpreter Training (2001)](http://)
This seminal work in the DC-S theory framework introduces various types of demands — (para)linguistic, environmental, interpersonal, and intrapersonal — and discusses their impacts on interpreter psychology.

### [Apprenticeship in SL Interpreting](http://)
Long needed yet sorely misunderstood, apprenticeships and supervision are the next frontier in the elevation of the field. Do you agree with Peterson and/or commenters here?
