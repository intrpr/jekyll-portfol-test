##     The Demand Control Schema for Interpreting Work (DC-S)
### The Demand Control Schema for Interpreting Work (DC-S) Required
Definition and explanation of Dean & Pollard’s Demand Control Schema
### Consumers and Service Effectiveness in Interpreting Work: A Practice Profession Perspective (2005) Required
Article by Dean & Pollard (2005) discusses the concept of SL interpreting as a practice profession and why overlooking outside factors on SL interpreters is potentially dangerous to the profession.
### Application of Demand-Control Theory to Sign Language Interpreting: Implications for Stress and Interpreter Training (2001)
This seminal work in the DC-S theory framework introduces various types of demands — (para)linguistic, environmental, interpersonal, and intrapersonal — and discusses their impacts on interpreter psychology.
### Apprenticeship in SL Interpreting
Long needed yet sorely misunderstood, apprenticeships and supervision are the next frontier in the elevation of the field. Do you agree with Peterson and/or commenters here?
