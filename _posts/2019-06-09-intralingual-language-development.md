Readings/Discussions

### [Interpreting Culturally Rich Realities: Research Implications for Successful Interpretations (Cokely)](http://)
This is a pre-published version of this article by Dennis Cokely, Dean of the ASL Program at Northeastern University, regarding meaning in ASL vocabularies and interpretations. (Published citation/reference: Cokely, D. (2001). Interpreting culturally rich realities: Research implications for successful interpretations. *Journal of Interpretation*, 2001.) We’ll be using this article to talk about message intent, vis-a-vis listening. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Cohesion & Transitional Devices (Spoken English)](http://)
This two-page handout taxonomizes four types of spoken English cohesion and transitional devices: additive, adversative, causal, and sequential transitions. Helpful in organizing mind/discoursal maps. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Understanding Registers of Language (ASL and English)](http://) <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### Look-Pause-Nod (Napier, Carmichael, & Wiltshire) 
(pp. 36 – 38.) This is chapter 2 in Hauser, 2008, *Deaf Professionals and Designated Interpreters* by Napier, Carmichael, & Wiltshire. Among important points like engagement via eye contact and attention, the conclusion of this paper reiterates the importance of appropriate and mature source language choices. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">Recommended</span>

### [Interpreters for Deaf Cut Through D.C.’s Political Jargon](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304773104579266792997670058)
Intralingual prowess cuts both ways: interpreters need to now how to pick the right words, but also be able to render equivalent ASL. Disappointing to see his strategy of “When lost in a minefield of jargon, the rule is ‘Spell, and you’re out of there,’” though.

(Update 15 Jan 2014: There is a fairly spirited discussion about this article on RID’s Facebook page; you’ll need to search for the shared link to the WSJ article; sign-in probably required.)

### [Actress Marlee Matlin presents](http://vimeo.com/11993141) to LDAV’s ‘Speaking of Kids’ Conference
This link is not about Marlee, it’s about listening to how [interpreter](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nataly-kelly/meet-jack-jason-the-most-_b_901712.html) [Jack](http://655jack.blogspot.com/) [Jason](https://twitter.com/655Jack) uses spoken English prosody, tone, affect, speed, and i[llocutionary force](http://) to make this a presentation, and not an interpreting assignment.

### [Why Academic ASL Exposure Matters to Sign Language Interpreters](http://www.streetleverage.com/2016/07/whole-picture-academic-asl-exposure-matters-sign-language-interpreters/)
2016 Street Leverage presentation by Ben Bahan (Gallaudet University) reminding interpreters that “each discipline of study in the academy has its own approach to discourse,” and one of the reasons why interpretations in academic settings are lacking: a lack of exposure to language in these disciplines.

### [Words that defined 2014](http://www.vox.com/2014/12/29/7417055/best-worst-words-2014)
“Thirsty for a hot take, Bae?” Great article that takes a proverbial pulse on how new additions — at least in 2014 — to the English lexicon are created, last, and/or die.
