## Developing semantic understanding between spoken English and signed languages

<p class="lead">Not only is having an expert command of spoken English and signed-language skills requisite to producing transliterated work, connecting these abilities for simultaneous production is also fundamental. A significant portion of this course will be spent on discussing, reacquiring, and synthesizing knowledge and fluency of grammatical skills inherent in both languages.</p>

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* How does X grammatical aspect manifest itself in signed language and spoken English? How does X differ in both languages and what can I do to create equivalent meaning in both?
* Will my language choices affect the intended register?
* What lessons and principles from spoken English impact my ability to produce a transliterated equivalent?

Readings/Discussions

### [Interpreting Culturally Rich Realities: Research Implications for Successful Interpretations (Cokely)](http://)
This is a pre-published version of this article by Dennis Cokely, Dean of the ASL Program at Northeastern University, regarding meaning in ASL vocabularies and interpretations. (Published citation/reference: Cokely, D. (2001). Interpreting culturally rich realities: Research implications for successful interpretations. *Journal of Interpretation*, 2001.) We’ll be using this article to talk about message intent, vis-a-vis listening. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Cohesion & Transitional Devices (Spoken English)](http://)
This two-page handout taxonomizes four types of spoken English cohesion and transitional devices: additive, adversative, causal, and sequential transitions. Helpful in organizing mind/discoursal maps. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### Look-Pause-Nod (Napier, Carmichael, & Wiltshire) 
(pp. 36 – 38.) This is chapter 2 in Hauser, 2008, *Deaf Professionals and Designated Interpreters* by Napier, Carmichael, & Wiltshire. Among important points like engagement via eye contact and attention, the conclusion of this paper reiterates the importance of appropriate and mature source language choices. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">Recommended</span>

### [Interpreters for Deaf Cut Through D.C.’s Political Jargon](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304773104579266792997670058)
Intralingual prowess cuts both ways: interpreters need to now how to pick the right words, but also be able to render equivalent ASL. Disappointing to see his strategy of “When lost in a minefield of jargon, the rule is ‘Spell, and you’re out of there,’” though.

(Update 15 Jan 2014: There is a fairly spirited discussion about this article on RID’s Facebook page; you’ll need to search for the shared link to the WSJ article; sign-in probably required.)
