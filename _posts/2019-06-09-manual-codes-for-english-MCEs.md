## Understanding transliteration morphology

<p class="lead">Transliterating between spoken English and codes of English is not the same as interpreting between spoken English and American Sign Language. Transliterators need to have familiarity with and skill in a variety of representations of both spoken English and English-bound sign systems to produce their work.</p>

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* What roots and overlaps do signed languages, American Sign Language, and other spoken languages share?
* Where did manual codes of English (MCEs) like Signed English and SEE originate and how are they produced?
* What is the difference between a manual code for English and an approach for representing spoken English?
* How is jargon (situational language) manifest in interpreting events? How do interpreters learn these signs?
