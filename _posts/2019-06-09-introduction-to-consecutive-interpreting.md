Readings/Discussions

### Consecutive Interpreting from English (Patrie)
Introduction & Terminology (pp. 11–20); Competencies (pp. 20–24); Models (pp. 25–28) <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [The Interpretive Theory of Translation and its Current Applications](http://)
(pp. 1–2) Written primarily for spoken language interpreters, Jungwha gives a brief introduction to the Interpretive Theory of Translation. Come for the four pillars (p. 2); stay for the whole thing. How much of Jungwha’s premise applies to SL interpreting or not? (Choi, J-W. (2003). The Interpretive Theory of Translation and Its Current Applications. Interpretation Studies, 3, pp. 1–15.) <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Towards a cognitive model of interpreting (Wilcox & Shaffer)](https://)
(pp. 27–38) This is chapter 2 in Janzen, Terry (2005) Topics in Signed Language Interpreting. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company. This article examines a handful of interpretation models and seats them in a context of anthropological applications to signed language interpretations. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

Focus mainly on section 2.x and 3.1 (can skim the rest); here’s the breakdown:

* 1.0 Introduction
* 2.1 Helper model
* 2.2 Conduit model
* 2.3 Semiotic model
* 2.4 Sociolinguistic model
* 2.5 Cognitive model
* 2.6 Bilingual/bicultural approach
* 3.1 “Understanding” 

### [Interactive Model of Interpreting (Stringham)](https://)
A basic interactive (from a base cognitive) model of interpreting based on Schein, Stewart, & Cartwright (2004). Pages 2–6 show how the model can be broken down and analyzed by participants, message, environments, and cognitive processes. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Entry to Practice Competencies for ASL/English Interpreters (DO-IT Center)](http://www.unco.edu/cebs/asl-interpreting/pdf/library/entry-to-practice-competencies.pdf)
(pp. 4–8) This white paper outlines five domains — theory and knowledge, human relations, language skills, interpreting skills, and professionalism competencies — that professional interpreters are expected to demonstrate in their work environments. (The DO-IT Center is now the Department of American Sign Language and Interpreting Studies.) <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Categorizing knowledge-lean and knowledge-rich skills (Taylor)](https://)
This excerpt is from Taylor, M. (2002) Interpretation Skills: American Sign Language to English. Edmonton, AB: Interpreting Consolidated. Dr. Taylor taxonomizes eight interpreter compentencies into knowledge-rich and knowledge-lean skills. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger">Required</span>

### [Consecutive and simultaneous interpreting (Russell)](https://)
(pp. 1–31; longer read) This is chapter 6 in Janzen, Terry (2005) Topics in Signed Language Interpreting. Amsterdam / Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company. This article compares and contrasts the consecutive and simultaneous disciplines, examines the use of consecutive interpreting in various settings, theoretical models, and when/when not to use consecutive interpreting strategies. <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success">Recommended</span>

### [Timeline of Interpreting and Sign Language Interpreting (Stringham)](http://)
A compiled history of milestones in language and signed language interpreting (cf. Schein, Stewart, & Cartwright (2004) and compiled from numerous sources).
