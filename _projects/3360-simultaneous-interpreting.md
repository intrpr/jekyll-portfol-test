## About this Course

<p class="lead">This course is an continuation of the process, skills, and theory required to produce spoken-English to signed and signed-to-spoken English language interpretations between Deaf and nondeaf people. Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:</p>

* demonstrate and self-monitor basic abilities required to create language interpretations of rehearsed and/or spontaneous texts:
	* understand how principles of the Demand-Control Schema (DC-S) can undergird ethical and best-practice interpreting decisions
	* increase competent usage of spoken English as source (sL) and target language (tL)
	* describe and apply the cognitive tasks of pegging, chunking, linking, and monitoring to understand a discourse
	* understand how dual-tasking and cognitive load theory impacts spoken language interpretation
	* incorporate practical applications of non-judgemental language (Colonomos, Witter-Merrithew, et al.) in personal and colleague work product
	* incorporate more advanced semantic choices and negotiation techniques, working with a variety of audience sizes and types
	* understand and develop practical skills for working in a team dynamic
	* recognize and properly address language difference in various genres (comedy, dramatic, age-appropriate, academic, legal, medical, literary/poetic, religious, entertainment, etc.)
	* developing sets of technical or field-specific signs and applying these to interpretative work
* identify impacts on and incorporation of semantic choice, register, and ethical behavioral decisions in consecutive interpretations

A significant portion of this course requires self-directed efforts (asychronously working with other teammates) and fairly good command of web-based technologies and learning environments (video creation, salient discussion, and reporting skills; we’ll discuss this more in class).

**This course requires a one-hour per week lab criteria**; students should expect to spend at least an hour a week on skill-building exercises in a language laboratory setting.
