## About this Course

<p class="lead">This online-only course is a seminar-like introduction and examination into the confluence of Deaf people and disability studies. Instructor/student interaction will be in both ASL and <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com">written English</a>. Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to demonstrate they can:</p>

* explain how American society constructs disability and contrast this with perspectives from disability studies and Deaf studies
* describe historical, social, political, religious, philosophical, and cultural influences on both Deaf and disabled people
* describe the complex relationship between Deaf and disability rights groups
* explain how Deaf persons and persons with disabilities construct their own meanings and identities
* articulate ways that the study of Deaf people might inform disability studies’ theoretical underpinnings
* apply principles taught in the course to conduct self-analysis toward understanding societal constructs of disability and Deaf people

### Additional Learning Objectives
In addition to the main learning objectives above, students should be able to demonstrate university-level ability in

* expressing appropriate and [expected civil netiquette](https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/474212/pages/course-etiquette-netiquette-and-contributing) in online conversations and commentary
* articulating personal reasoning when comparing (the same) and contrasting (different) perspectives and observations
* deducing, constructing, and expressing a research-informed opinion
* producing [academic ASL-styled presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX18-4m-EN0) and accurate usage of [APA referencing and citation form](http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/henrichsenl/APA/APA01.html).
* As you know, this course requires your completely self-directed efforts (a/synchronously working with other colleagues) and fairly good command of web-based technologies and learning environments (video creation, salient discussion, and reporting skills).
