## About this Course

<p class="lead">This course is an introduction to signed language (SL) interpreting theory and bidirectional (ASL-to-English and English-to-ASL) interpreting between Deaf and nondeaf people. Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:</p>

* describe the language interpretation and signed language interpreting professions including their histories and evolution
* describe and understand external and internal physical, psychological, and ethical (including the ramifications and evolution of the RID’s Code of Professional Conduct) influences on SL interpreters
* understand cognitive and other current models of interpreting (Schein, Stewart & Cartwright; Cokely; Colonomos; McIntire & Sanderson, etc.) used by SL interpreters
* understand business practices and future trends of the SL interpreting field
* describe the varieties of settings where SL interpreters work
* demonstrate ability in gathering and composing research germane to the SL interpreting field
* understand basic concepts and skills required to accurately interpret simple texts from English to ASL and from ASL to English

In addition, this course will help prepare candidates to take the [Utah State](https://jobs.utah.gov/usor/uip/certification/index.html) and/or [RID NIC](http://rid.org/education/testing/index.cfm) written examination.

A significant portion of this course requires self-directed efforts (a/sychronously working with other colleagues) and fairly good command of web-based technologies and learning environments (video creation, salient discussion and reporting skills; we’ll discuss this more in class).

Note: All downloadable files—class notes, syllabi, and other handouts—are saved in PDF formats and require Adobe Acrobat Reader. If the computer you are using does not have Acrobat or the Acrobat browser plugin, [you can download it free](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html).
